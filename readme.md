# Sheltie

Sheltie is an app available for iOS and Android developed to provide an easy way to view pets from nearby animal shelters. The app is built in React Native with an Expo-managed workflow. Download links for the iOS and Android apps can be found on the [sheltie.app](https://sheltie.app) homepage.

## Sheltie.app Domain

The app uses its own API for authentication, which is hosted on its domain at [sheltie.app](https://sheltie.app). The app also supports deep linking (or universal linking for iOS) on this domain via the *sheltie.app/pet?id=\_\_\_\_\_\_* links. These can be generated via the "Share" button on any Pet Detail page.
